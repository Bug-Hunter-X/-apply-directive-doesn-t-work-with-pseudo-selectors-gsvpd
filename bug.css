This bug occurs when using Tailwind CSS's `@apply` directive with a utility class that contains a pseudo-selector (like `:hover`, `:focus`, or `:active`).  The `@apply` directive doesn't correctly apply the styles associated with the pseudo-selector. For example, `@apply hover:bg-blue-500` will not change the background color on hover.
